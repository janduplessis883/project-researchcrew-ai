![ResearchCrew AI](images/researchcrew-ai-logo.png)

Effortlessly refine your **clinical research Expression of Interest (EOI) submissions** with **CrewAI**. Our intelligent agents analyze and optimize your recruitment strategies, helping you achieve the best possible outcomes while staying grounded and approachable.

Using **CrewAI Flows**, every step of your recruitment plan is reviewed and enhanced to ensure high-quality suggestions that are tailored to your study’s unique needs. Whether it’s identifying participants, leveraging your network, or overcoming recruitment challenges, CrewAI takes care of the details so you can focus on the big picture.

Once optimized, seamlessly export your findings into a **Notion** database of your choice through an intuitive **Streamlit app**. This integration makes managing your insights and streamlining your workflow easier than ever, ensuring that your EOIs not only stand out but also deliver results.

### Specifications for the CrewAI Project

Below is a breakdown of the functional, technical, and user-oriented specifications needed to bring the project to life:

#### 1. Core Features

**A. EOI Optimization**

- **EOI Input:**
  - Users can upload raw EOI drafts (PDF, Word, or plain text) or fill out a form within the app.
  - Upload Study Documentation to generate study summary.
  - Highlight key elements like recruitment methods, participant identification, and staffing details.
- **AI-Powered Optimization:**
  - CrewAI agents analyze EOIs using NLP (Natural Language Processing) to identify gaps, improve phrasing, and suggest enhancements.
  - Suggestions are based on recruitment best practices, industry standards, and previous successful EOIs.
- **Scoring System:**
  - A scoring system evaluates the quality of the EOI on metrics such as clarity, feasibility, and alignment with sponsor expectations.
  - A final “CrewAI Score” is provided, with a breakdown of how to improve weaker areas.

**B. Recruitment Strategy Suggestions**

- **CrewAI Flows:**
  - Generates tailored recruitment strategies based on study details, such as:
    - Study type (observational or interventional).
    - Patient population (age, condition, geography, diversity needs).
    - Known challenges (e.g., language barriers, time constraints).
  - Suggests alternative approaches like EHR searches, PCN collaboration, PIC sites, or community engagement.
- **Dynamic Outputs:**
  - CrewAI provides actionable steps (e.g., “Send SMS invites to X patients with condition Y”).
  - Alternative “Plan B” strategies are suggested if challenges arise.

#### 2. Integration with Notion

- **Export to Notion:**
