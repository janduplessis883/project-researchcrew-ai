2.4 Community Engagement & Outreach

To enhance recruitment—particularly among NIHR under-served groups—The Chelsea Practice implements a robust, multifaceted community engagement strategy:
	1.	Informational Sessions
	•	Regular sessions within the local community, explaining the study purpose, procedures, benefits, and eligibility criteria.

3. Potential Challenges in Recruitment
	1.	Disease Severity & Patient Availability
	•	Advanced disease stages may limit patient mobility and ability to attend frequent visits.
	•	Comorbidities (e.g., cardiovascular disease, diabetes) may complicate eligibility and study consistency.
	2.	Treatment Burden & Compliance
	•	Subcutaneous Administration: Patients may be apprehensive about injections or potential side effects.
	•	Complex Regimens: Polypharmacy and drug interactions can deter patients from joining or continuing a trial.
	3.	Recruitment & Retention
	•	Patient Awareness: Requires effective communication, outreach, and education.
	•	Retention: Ongoing engagement is vital for consistent follow-up, especially if participants experience side effects or logistical barriers.
	4.	Socioeconomic & Demographic Factors
	•	Accessibility: Lack of transportation or financial resources can limit participation.
	•	Diverse Populations: Tailored approaches are required to reach minority groups who may have varying levels of trust in clinical research.
	5.	Regulatory & Ethical Considerations
	•	Informed Consent: Ensuring participants understand investigational product implications is crucial, particularly for those with low health literacy.

4. Strategies to Overcome Challenges
	1.	Enhanced Patient Education & Support
