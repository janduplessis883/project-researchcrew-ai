Primary care is a vital cornerstone of healthcare delivery, and it offers a unique environment for clinical research because it captures such a wide range of patient experiences and demographics. However, recruiting participants in primary care can be challenging. Factors such as patient flow, limited time for clinicians, and strict study requirements often require us to be resourceful and creative. Below is an overview of various methods, including the use of electronic health records (like SystmOne), outreach through Primary Care Networks (PCNs), and alternative approaches that can be used if initial plans don’t unfold as expected.

1. Building a Strong Foundation for Recruitment
The first step is to clearly define the target population. This means working closely with the study’s principal investigators (PIs) to determine eligibility criteria, such as age, medical history, and any comorbidities. Once you’re armed with that knowledge, you can tailor your recruitment strategy to identify potential participants effectively. For instance, if the study focuses on patients with diabetes, you might plan EHR searches for HbA1c levels or relevant diagnostic codes. This clarity reduces wasted time and prevents you from casting too wide a net that may produce irrelevant or ineligible patients.

Equally important is maintaining a positive relationship with the clinic staff. The receptionists, nurses, and general practitioners are the gatekeepers to the patients’ attention. Communicating the study’s benefits and scientific aims—while also clarifying any logistical details—can help staff feel motivated to support the recruitment drive. A well-informed team can point potentially eligible patients your way or mention the study during routine interactions.

2. Utilizing Electronic Health Records (EHR) with SystmOne
One of the most powerful tools in a clinical research coordinator’s arsenal is the EHR system. In the UK, many primary care practices use systems like SystmOne to store and manage patient data. Properly leveraging SystmOne involves three main steps:
	1.	Refining Search Criteria: When you’re ready to generate a list of potentially eligible participants, start by using the built-in query tool to filter patients based on inclusion or exclusion criteria. For example, if you’re investigating a new hypertension medication, you might query all patients between certain ages who have high blood pressure codes recorded in the system and meet the medication history criteria.
	2.	Data Extraction and Validation: Once the search is complete, it’s crucial to validate that these patients are good candidates. This can mean reviewing their recent lab results, or any complexities in their medical background that might affect the study. If the study has sensitive inclusion or exclusion criteria, performing a quick chart review for each flagged patient helps ensure you’re not inviting individuals who are clearly ineligible.
	3.	Invitations and Follow-Ups: With a curated list of potential participants, the next step is to send invitation letters, text messages, or calls. Often, direct contact from a nurse or GP is more effective than a blanket letter. SystmOne helps in creating mail merges or automated text messages, streamlining your communication efforts. This step must be carried out with respect for privacy regulations (such as GDPR in the UK), ensuring personal data is managed securely. The Chelsea Practice uses a 2-way SMS service to communicate with potential participants, it is an effective in patient centred communication, with the ability to follow-up on any patient queries. This also helps retain particpants.

3. The Role of PCNs and PIC Sites
Primary Care Networks (PCNs) bring together multiple general practices to serve a local population in a more collaborative manner. These networks often have shared resources, like pharmacists, mental health workers, and social prescribers. They also may have a dedicated research facilitator or champion. Tapping into the PCN infrastructure can significantly broaden your reach.
	•	Cross-Practice Collaboration: When initial recruitment at one site proves insufficient, reaching out to partner practices within the PCN can dramatically increase your pool of potential participants. By centralizing certain tasks—like patient identification or promotional materials—you can create efficiencies and reduce the burden on any single practice.
	•	PIC (Participant Identification Centre) Sites: PIC sites function as “support” practices that help identify potential participants but may not be the main location where the study procedures occur. Having one or more PIC sites can be a game-changer if your own practice is small or has already exhausted its potential patient pool. Essentially, these sites will conduct EHR searches or opportunistic recruitment for you and refer interested patients to your site for the actual study activities. This approach can be especially helpful if you’re running a specialized trial or one requiring a particular group of participants.
  •	The Chelsea Practice is part of Brompton Health PCN, we have weekly PCN meetings where infomration regarding recruitement could be reviewed and intervention be expedited if recruitment is not as planned.
  •	Utilizing PCN ARRS Staff and MCMW (My Care My Way) staff who manages patients over 65 yrs with proactive care planning. This is a great resource if the recruitment demographic falls within this age range. Senior Care Navigators knows this cofhort of patient extremely well and will be able to advise regarding patient suitability/interest in clinical research.

4. When Recruitment Does Not Go to Plan
Even the best-prepared strategies might falter when put into practice. Sometimes patients just aren’t interested, or the eligibility criteria are too narrow, or perhaps the study demands are perceived as too burdensome. In these moments, it’s vital to have a plan B—and possibly a plan C—ready.

One alternative is to consider adjusting your patient messaging. If you initially tried sending only letters, you might switch to phone calls, text messages, or email invites. In some cases, a personal touch via a brief phone call can make a difference for patients who are on the fence. Another adjustment might be timing. If a large portion of your patient population is at work during the day, scheduling evening phone calls or sending texts that can be read after work hours may improve response rates.

If the PCN route wasn’t part of your original blueprint, it might be time to bring in additional practices and even set up new PIC sites. Many research studies have found success in quickly pivoting to a multi-site approach once they realize that a single practice can’t meet the recruitment goals.

5. Creative Community Engagement
Sometimes you have to think outside the box (or beyond the clinic walls). Here are a few creative community engagement ideas:
	•	Local Health Events: Partner with charities or community centres hosting health-related events. A stall or presentation about the study can inform attendees who might be eligible. It also helps demystify clinical research and fosters trust in the local population.
	•	Patient Advocacy Groups: If the study focuses on a specific condition (e.g., diabetes, arthritis, or asthma), linking with local patient advocacy or support groups can yield fruitful recruitment. These groups often have engaged members who are interested in advancing research for their condition.
	•	Social Media and Online Platforms: Although privacy considerations and ethical guidelines must be carefully observed, using targeted social media ads or practice websites can be another route. If your practice has a social media presence, you could post information about the study, inviting patients to learn more.
	•	Newsletter or Bulletins: If your practice or PCN sends out a regular newsletter, a small write-up about the study can catch the eye of curious potential participants.

6. Creating an Inviting Experience
Beyond the practical tactics for identifying participants, it’s essential to make the experience inviting and easy for them. This might involve:
	•	Simplified Consent Process: Use plain language, clearly outline what the study involves, and be transparent about any risks or benefits. When participants see that the study is approachable, they’re more likely to sign on.
	•	Flexible Appointments: Offer appointments at various times (including weekends or evenings) if possible. Working adults often struggle to attend weekday appointments, so a broader range of options is appealing.
	•	Brief and Friendly Communication: Whether you’re reaching out by phone or email, keep messages short and positive. A friendly tone—something like “We’d love to tell you more about this study that could benefit patients like you!”—makes a big difference in initial engagement.

7. Monitoring and Ongoing Adjustments
No matter the strategies you employ, keep a close watch on what’s working and what isn’t. Tracking metrics such as the number of invitations sent, the number of positive responses, and the number of enrollments offers valuable insight. If you notice a sudden drop in engagement, reevaluate your messaging, contact methods, or even the time of day you’re reaching out to potential participants.

Research is rarely linear. You might discover that your best leads come from unexpected places, like a local community group or an online forum. Embrace flexibility, iterate on your approach, and be ready to try new things. Regularly share these observations with the clinical research team so everyone remains aligned and informed.

8. Concluding Thoughts
Recruitment in primary care can be both exciting and challenging. Each practice, and each patient population, is different, meaning one-size-fits-all approaches rarely work. By leveraging EHR systems like SystmOne, collaborating with PCNs, establishing PIC sites, and thinking creatively about outreach and engagement, you can overcome many of the typical barriers to recruitment.

Remember, recruitment isn’t just about filling quotas; it’s about inviting the right individuals to participate in research that can truly improve patient care and healthcare outcomes. Whether it’s a small pilot study or a large-scale randomized controlled trial, a thoughtful, patient-centred approach to recruitment ensures that the process is respectful, efficient, and ultimately, successful.

That said, research coordination is dynamic, and so is your patient population. Stay observant, stay adaptable, and be ready to pivot when you need to. By combining meticulous data-driven searches on SystmOne with strong relationships across PCNs, alongside creative community engagement methods, you’ll be well positioned to meet and even exceed your study’s recruitment goals.
